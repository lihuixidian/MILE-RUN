# MILE-RUN
A movement-aware location selection algorithm (published in Information Sciences 18)

Given the movement history (e.g., historical trajactory/check-in logs) for massive users, how to find a location to deploy the next facility, while there are *k* existing ones, such that the aggregated utility for the facility network is maximized. We present a novel model, namely MILE-RUN, that can address the aforementioned problem efficiently. The results of this work have been published in the following papers, please cite the following appropriately if you are using the code for MILE-RUN.

This work is part of our ongoing project, namely Movement-Aware Location Selection (MALOS). Besides MILE-RUN, given the movement history (e.g., historical trajactory/check-in logs) for massive users, we've also conducted research works on several other problems, including:

- Find the best location to deploy the facility such that it will probably cover the most number of moving users.
- Find a facility, from *k* existing ones, and relocate it to another place such that the utility can be maximized.
- Find *k* location to place facilities such that the aggregated utility can be maximized.
